# Overview

This is my head-first dive into C++. I'm trying to use several features of the language that seem useful
or will be applicable in development of C++ projects (i.e. Makefile).

This is a small game where you battle randomly generated enemies one after another.
Think of it as a bullet-hell combined with an turn based combat game.

I wanted to take a concept I was somewhat familar with and implement it in a new programming language
that I haven't really used the features of before.

[comment]: <> (Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.)

# Development Environment

This project was developed using Kate text editor with GDB extensions for debugging.
The compiler intended to be used is `g++` with `make`.

The language is C++ and tries to make use of exclusively the standard library as much as possible.
The eventual goal is to make it so this project can be ported to a microcontroller.
